				<p>The player has the ability to move through a robust state machine, they can roll, block, move, stand still, or attack
					Each move give the player the ability to fight and avoid enemies. Elements such as the shield and attack will have charges, so their use will be limited.

				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>My main process was an aim for the look and feel of the game. Animations and sounds had to match, and everything had to look good. This also meant
					that the other elements, such as the background and the music, also had to add to the the aestetic of the game. I tried very hard to make sure nothing felt out of place.
					Many of the in-game mechanics and rules were defined through testing, seeing what worked, and what felt good and normal. I messed with transitions to states, timing to allow the animations to play, and ways to get from one state to another,
					all with the goal of creating interesting gameplay that was fun and not too difficult for the the user. In terms of other resources used, I used a few of Prof. Chin's tutorial videos, as well as circle blast, and documentation for howler and pixi.

				<h2>Requirments</h2>
				<p>
					My project meets the requirments laid out in the rubric.
					It uses an ES6 class, has validation for css and html. No known user actions break the game.
					The images are optimized and small, and many are scaled up via code. Documentation is done. The console has no errors and or console.log calls.
