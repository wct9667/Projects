        <p>I am currently a second year student within the Game Design and Development major at Rochester Insitute of Technology.
            I have significant skills programming within C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have skills within other tools, such as Unity, and Maya.
            Outside of classes, I partake in Jazz Ensemble as a trumpet player, and I play in RIT's flag football club.</p>

        </div>
        <p>This game was another school project. Within this project I worked alone witin Unity, using C# to program the game logic.
            It has a very similar style to my bullet-hell game, but I built in many new systems that made my work more efficent. I added 
            pools of enemies and bullets, which made the game much more efficient. I also experimented with random spawning and respawning of enemies.
            As well as implenting animations for collisions. <a href = "https://igme-202-2221.github.io/project-1-wct9667/builds/Build%204/" target="_blank">Live Build</a>

                <p>
                    Test of Wills was a class group project that I worked on in a team of 4.
                    Within this game the player must survive against different bosses in
                    a bullet-hell like environment. The game was programmed in C#, using 
                    Monogame as the engine. I personally organized and led the group, designing the architecture of the game.
                    I also did a majority of the programming, including game states, data loading and saving, and overall gameplay
                    logic.

            <h2>Desert Temple Scene</h2><br>
        </div>
        <p>This project was made for a 3d animatios class. I had had to used Maya to model all of the assets that I used. Then I UV unwrapped the model and applied textures using Adobe Substance Painter.
            I took my finished assets and imported them into Unity, combining them with Unities terrain system, fps controller, skybox, and sound systems to create a walkable scene to display the assets I created.

        <h2><a href = "https://people.rit.edu/wct9667/235/Project3" target="_blank">Dawn of Winter</a></h2><br>
        </div>

        <p>
            Dawn of Winter is solo academic project, made using PIXI-JS, HTML-5 and CSS.
            The premise of this game is that the player must survive as long as they can, racking up score by defeating enemies, and moving forward.
            The majority of my efforts went to the feel of the game. The ambience and environment of the game is meant to further the players connection to the character they are playing.
            I added in snow, ambience related to wind, and sfx that matched up closely to the actions of the player. The main part of the game outside of the "feeling" and effect of the assets was the state machine associated with the player.
            The player has as relatively diverse set of actions, they can heal, attack, block, move or roll. (note: headphones recommended):<a href = "https://people.rit.edu/wct9667/235/Project3" target="_blank">Live Build</a>
