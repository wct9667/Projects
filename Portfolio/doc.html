    <h2>Image Souces</h2>
    <p>image sources-phase one: <br>
        <a href = "src/02_preview2.pdf">Source Design</a> I used one I found, the second page in specific.

        Notes: I searched a bit for the font for the 56 and simply could not find one for free.<br>

        <p>The purpose of the final page will be a portfolio. This means that it will include projects, contact information and a resume. My design will be tailored to employers
        who will be looking at my portfolio. Due to this my design will be more simplistic, trying to lead the audience right to the essential contact. I wlill start with my intro, then go right into projects
    THe contact information and the resume must also be easily accessible.</p>
    <h2>Sketches</h2>

<h3>Big Changes</h3>
<p>I made alot of changes to simplify the layout, mainly to ensure usabilty as a portfolio, and to adapt the content to make sense for a portfolio.
    I move the navbar from the side to the top, and changed the intro from the side to the top as well, as to ensure the user sees content in the right order.
    Each project block used much of the same css and html as before, but I made changes and added a background image, with overlaid text and video. 
    I thought this might be a good way to lay out the content for each piece in a concise way. The videos took a bit of time to make work well, but I found some css that allowed forfull screen which was neat.
</p>
<h3>other notes</h3>
<p>The images for this I gathered myself, as well as the videos, and there are also 2 placeholders, which should be filled by the end of the year, which will be in the same format as the other 2 blocks</p>

Also, validation says the shape-outside does not exist, but it does?
